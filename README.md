# ML_Book_Classification
This project focuses on unsupervised machine learning models to classify various book texts into unlabeled genres. Since book genres already exist Iâ€™m very curious to see the patterns that a machine learning model will pull out of texts as opposed to attempting to classify them into pre-existing themes. The end goal is to be able to offer companies a new and potentially improved scheme for labeling books which will aid in consumer recommendation systems. Theoretically, an unsupervised model will be able to see patterns that may not be included in the traditional book genres helping suggest books to consumers that may not occur to an expert.

The data used was collected from Project Gutenberg, an online library of open-source texts (expired copyrights, or granted rights).

You can view this project in three formats:

1. The full code and ML output with markdown follow along

2. A powerpoint deck (highlights info, easiest to consume but lacking some ML output)

3. A full comprehensive paper with most of the ML output
